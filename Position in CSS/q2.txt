Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.
->Relative position places an element relative to its current position.
Absolute places an element relative to its parents position.

Relative positioning:
# Places an element relative to its current position
# Doesn't change the layout around it
# Can be moved
# Positioned relative to itself

Absolute positioning:
# places an element relative to its parents position
# Changes the layout around it
# positioned relative to its first positioned parents
# if there is a parent, it works like fixed
